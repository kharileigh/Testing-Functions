What functionality does each of the methods in the class have?
What sorts of types in the list might be testable?
If we were only ever dealing with integers (let's say), then what sorts of interesting list contents at instantiation and later on (after adding new) could be worth including in the tests?
How many different outcomes are there that are testable, from get_most_often() and do you have tests for those?
Do your tests cover at least all of the core functionality of the class, even if you aren't testing every type in the list or every combination of inputs?
